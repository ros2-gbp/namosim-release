  abstract   = {In this paper, we address the problem of Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO): a practical extension to navigation for humanoids and other dexterous mobile robots. The robot is permitted to reconfigure the environment by moving obstacles and clearing free space for a path. This paper presents a resolution complete planner for a subclass of NAMO problems. Our planner takes advantage of the navigational structure through state-space decomposition and heuristic search. The planning complexity is reduced to the difficulty of the specific navigation task, rather than the dimensionality of the multi-object domain. We demonstrate real-time results for spaces that contain large numbers of movable obstacles. We also present a practical framework for single-agent search that can be used in algorithmic reasoning about this domain.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we present the first decision theoretic planner for the problem of Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO). While efficient planners for NAMO exist, they are challenging to implement in practice due to the inherent uncertainty in both perception and control of real robots. Generalizing existing NAMO planners to nondeterministic domains is particularly difficult due to the sensitivity of MDP methods to task dimensionality. Our work addresses this challenge by combining ideas from Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search, and results in an algorithm that can be used for fast online planning in uncertain environments. We evaluate our algorithm in simulation, and provide a theoretical argument for our results which suggest linear time complexity in the number of obstacles for typical environments.},

  abstract   = {In computational science and computer graphics, there is a strong requirement to represent and visualize information in the real domain, and many visualization data structures and algorithms have been proposed to achieve this aim. Unfortunately, the dataflow model that is often selected to address this issue in visualization systems is not flexible enough to visualize newly invented data structures and algorithms because this scheme can accept only specific data structures. To address this problem, we propose a new visualization tool, RViz, which is independent of the input information data structures. Since there is no requirement for additional efforts to manage the flow networks and the interface to abstracted information is simple in RViz, any scientific information visualization algorithms are easier to implement than the dataflow model. In this paper, we provide case studies in which we have successfully implemented new data structures and related algorithms using RViz, including geometry synthesis, distance field representation, and implicit surface reconstruction. Through these cases, we show how RViz helps users visualize and understand any hidden insights in input information.},
